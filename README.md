Test automation suite example built in Python Robot Framework

Prerequisites, python python-pip, web browser (Firefox or Chrome, IE with limited functionality.)

Basically you want to follow the installation instructions at the SeleniumLibrary github pages, since that will install the latest version of the RobotFramework as a dependency.

pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
Plain Robot Framework installation can be performed by issuing

pip install robotframework
However, SeleniumLibrary will bring a lot of additional functionality needed with the tests.
